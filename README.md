# Cheat Demonstration for AssaultCube

This project is a demonstration of a cheat for the open-source game **AssaultCube**. The purpose of this repository is strictly educational, created for studying and learning about cheat development techniques, memory manipulation, and software analysis.

> **Important**: This code is **for educational purposes only** and should be used solely in learning environments and experimentation with open-source games. 

## About the Project

AssaultCube is an open-source first-person shooter, making it an ideal subject for studying and experimenting with code. This demonstration focuses on development practices and cheat exploitation techniques specifically for open-source games, with emphasis on:

- Memory manipulation to detect or alter game variables
- Real-time reading and writing of in-game values
- Fundamentals of cheat development in open-source games

## Features

This cheat includes basic functionalities such as:

- **Maximize Health**: Sets playerâ€™s health to the maximum value.
- **Maximize Ammo**: Increases primary weapon ammo to the maximum capacity.
- **Maximize Ammo Reload**: Maximizes reload ammo for the primary weapon.

These features are implemented at a basic level to demonstrate the principles behind each mechanic.
